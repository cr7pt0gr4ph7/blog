This is the first installment of a series where I write down the stuff that
I stumbled upon during the week, but which was not large enough to warrant its own post.

### #1 &mdash; GitHub Pages and custom gems

While working on this blog, and scratching my head about the build errors
related to using a custom theme, this article helped me a lot:

> [How to build and deploy GitHub Pages with custom gems](https://www.fatlemon.co.uk/2023/12/custom-gems-with-github-pages/) by [Andrew Freemantle](https://www.fatlemon.co.uk/)

Just note that &ndash; contrary to the linked article &ndash; replacing the `ruby-version: 3.1`
is neither necessary nor recommended anymore, because [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) supports Ruby 3.0+ now,
and Bundler even requires Ruby 3.0+.

### #2 &mdash; Awesome CSS-related websites

While getting up to speed with the newest CSS features, I stumbled upon the following
tools, which are listed here in no particular order, and with the knowledge there are probably
even better tools for the same job out there.

* [css.glass &ndash; Glassmorphism CSS Generator](https://css.glass/) by [@miketromba](https://twitter.com/miketromba)
* [box-shadow.dev &ndash; CSS Box Shadows](https://box-shadow.dev/) by [twobeards.dev](https://twobeards.dev/)

Also, a shoutout to the ever-great [css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com) with its articles and almanac,
which is as concise, practical, useful and on-point as ever.
And who could forget [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) and [Can I Use ___?](https://caniuse.com/).

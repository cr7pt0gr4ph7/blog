Here are a few useful web tools for creating color palettes:

* [Adobe Color Palettes](https://color.adobe.com/en/create/color-wheel):
  Full-fledged color palette creator. Also allows extracting color palettes from images.
* [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/):
  Generate a load of different color palettes from a single base color.
* [Khroma](https://www.khroma.co/):
  AI-based, generates foreground plus background pairings.
  Great if you need bright color pairings that look very flashy but which you wouldn't think of by yourself.
* [ColorHunt](https://colorhunt.co/):
  Crowd-sourced color palettes.

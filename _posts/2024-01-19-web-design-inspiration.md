Looking for some inspiration inspiration? The following sites got you covered!

* [SiteInspire.com](https://www.siteinspire.com/) has a lot of really good and _art-sy looking_ websites with great typography.

* [Webdesign Inspiration](https://www.webdesign-inspiration.com/), as the name implies, also has a lot of websites listed.
  The focus here is not solely on the artistic side of things; it has also a lot "more run-of-the-mill" websites.
  But, two be honest, the most web designers will probably work more with the latter than the former during their day job;
  and they are still good designs.

* [CSS Mania](https://www.cssmania.com/) is an interesting juxtaposition (as of the time of this writing):
  Its design itself is, well&hellip; fitting for its site slogan: "Inspiring you since 2004".
  But it lists a lot of good websites, and is kind of a middle ground between the previous two when it comes
  to the _artsy_ vs. _basic_ ratio.

And, as a last contender:

* [Designspiration](https://www.designspiration.com/): This site is not exactly about _web design_, 
  and more about design in general, but you scan scroll through thousands upon thousands of mostly-blank-and-white pictures
  of great visual design and typography to get your creativity going.

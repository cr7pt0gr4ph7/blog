While designing a business card with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org), I found the following tools
which were very helpful:
 
* [SVGOMG &ndash; SVGGO's Missing GUI](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/), which is a one-page web app
  based on the [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo) SVG Optimizer Node.js package.

That's it for this week. See you next time!

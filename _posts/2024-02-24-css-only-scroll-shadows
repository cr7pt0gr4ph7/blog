Scroll shadows are a useful tool for indicating to a user that they can scroll in a certain direction.
[Lea Verou][lv-scroll-shadows] has pioneered a technique for implementing these using CSS only,
which has been picked up by e.g. [CSS-Tricks][css-tricks-scroll-shadows].

I've employed this technique in a prototype for a desktop/mobile web app for the horizontal scrolling of a (possibly very wide) breadcrumb bar.
where I wanted to avoid displaying a scroll bar both for aesthetic and for space reasons,
as well as to avoid layout jumps due to the scrollbar appearing when resizing the application window.

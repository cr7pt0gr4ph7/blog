It is a suprisingly complex topic to supply all the correct favicons for the [diverse range][screen-stats] of [devices][device-stats] and [browsers][browser-stats] that are in use today.
It started with just `favicon.ico` in 32x32 (or 16x16), but now you also need high-resolution icons for iPhone and iPad
even larger icons for Progressive Web Application (PWA) splash screens &mdash;
and Google for example [requires icons that are a multiple of 48x48px square][google-ico-guidelines]...
it's quite a mess for something that is just supposed to be a little icon, albeit one of the main brandings of your website. 

Well, worry no more! This **[blog post][six-favicon-files]** contains a good guide on which files are still required today.

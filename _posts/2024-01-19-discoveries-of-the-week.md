This week's post is a bit smaller that the last one, but contains some goodies nonetheless. Let's get started!

### #1 &mdash; Flowing text around and within shapes

Did you know that you can use simple CSS to flow text around a circular (or many other kinds of) shapes?

* [_`shape-outside`_ on css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/s/shape-outside/)
* [_`shape-outside`_ on caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_shape-outside)

and, with some CSS magic and two elements, also [within a circular (or any other kind of) shape](https://devdojo.com/temani-afif/wrapping-text-inside-a-circular-shape)?

#### Quick aside: A short bit of web browser history

I am really amazed how far CSS and the web platform as a whole have come in the last few years.

When I started out, you still had to fight with IE and its quirks &mdash; and now, most things are just&hellip; _easy_.
We got Flexbox, CSS Grid, Animations, CSS Variables, `calc()` and more; and thanks to auto-updating web browsers,
it is now more a question of _months_ (rather than _years_) before new features arrive for the dominant share of the user base.

I don't want to continue ranting, so just have a look at the development of the browser history share
during the last 10 years: [Browser Marked Share 2009-2020](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#yearly-2009-2020) by GlobalStats.

### #2 &mdash; Web Design &amp; General Design Inspiration

Looking for some inspiration inspiration? The following sites got you covered!

* [SiteInspire.com](https://www.siteinspire.com/) has a lot of really good and _art-sy looking_ websites with great typography.

* [Webdesign Inspiration](https://www.webdesign-inspiration.com/), as the name implies, also has a lot of websites listed.
  The focus here is not solely on the artistic side of things; it has also a lot "more run-of-the-mill" websites.
  But, two be honest, the most web designers will probably work more with the latter than the former during their day job;
  and they are still good designs.

* [CSS Mania](https://www.cssmania.com/) is an interesting juxtaposition (as of the time of this writing):
  Its design itself is, well&hellip; fitting for its site slogan: "Inspiring you since 2004".
  But it lists a lot of good websites, and is kind of a middle ground between the previous two when it comes
  to the _artsy_ vs. _basic_ ratio.

And, as a last contender:

* [Designspiration](https://www.designspiration.com/): This site is not exactly about _web design_, 
  and more about design in general, but you scan scroll through thousands upon thousands of mostly-blank-and-white pictures
  of great visual design and typography to get your creativity going.

That's it for this week. See you next time!

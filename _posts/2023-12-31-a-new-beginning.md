Well, I've finally done it. It took a long time, but now it is here: A personal blog to write down random thoughts,
discoveries and coding lessons that I stumble upon through my job or through random chance.

I love the chance to finally share what's going through my mind!

The articles on here are going to be a mix of **wildly different topics**, from Android to software architecture,
from CSS to C#, from WebAssembly and Linux. Whatever piques (and manages to retain) my interest at the moment.
So strap in, join me in my personal learnings, and enjoy the ride &mdash; its going to be entertaining,
and maybe you'll even learn something on the way.

As an aside, I'll try to tag everything, so you can choose which topics interest you.

Oh, what? I didn't introduce myself? How rude of me! I'm 30 years old, have studied information technology,
worked as a software developer for 8 years, am also a dance teacher and love to learn new things.
I've worked a lot with C# and .NET on the desktop during my previous day job,
but with a lot of different topics on the side.

I've also dabbled in Go, web design, Android apps, Kotlin, Gradle builds and plugins,
Infrastructure as Code, VM automation, Ruby, Python, and a bit of machine learning thrown in for good measure.

I am really amazed how far CSS and the web platform as a whole have come in the last few years.

When I started out, you still had to fight with IE and its quirks &mdash; and now, most things are just&hellip; _easy_.
We got Flexbox, CSS Grid, Animations, CSS Variables, `calc()` and more; and thanks to auto-updating web browsers,
it is now more a question of _months_ (rather than _years_) before new features arrive for the dominant share of the user base.

I don't want to continue ranting, so just have a look at the development of the browser history share
during the last 10 years: [Browser Marked Share 2009-2020](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#yearly-2009-2020) by GlobalStats.
